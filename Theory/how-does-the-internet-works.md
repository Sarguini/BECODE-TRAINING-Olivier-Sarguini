# How ***Internet*** works?

## The Internet

Internet's a big **wire** across the world. It's like our physic world, where your **adress** are the **IP adress** and your **letter box** are the **modem**.

### Difference between *servers* and *clients*

On the *internet*, you have two different groups:   - Servers 
                                                    - Clients

Servers are  very big *hard disc* where are stored different type of data depending on the usefulness of these server (mails for *Gmail*)

Clients are all the others. When you surf on the web, you are a *client*.

## The packaging

All informations on the **wire** are divided into several *packages* and are gathered by the modem.

### Example:

You want send a ***email*** to your neighbour...

- You read it on your PC and send it.
- The ***email*** go to your **modem**
- The **modem** divides it on several *packages*.
- The ***email*** ride on the **wire** to the **modem**'s neighbour.
- The **modem**'s neighbour gathers all *packages* of your ***email***.
